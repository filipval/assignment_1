# Wassily Chair Website

Using HTML and CSS fundamentals, i have designed and developed this fictional website for the Wassily Chair. The purpose of this assignment is to gain practical experience in understanding and implementing fundamental HTML and CSS concepts. The website includes two pages, one for presenting information about the Wassily Chair, and another including a form for ordering the chair.

## Usage

To use the Wassily Chair website, open the Netlify link below, scroll through the about page and read through the chair details, click the Order Here button, and fill out the form. The website is fictional, and is not functional.

## Features
